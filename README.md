# NodeMCU
My NodeMCU Project
We have raised a project ourselves.
The project is a product that a fish tank with lights controller by WIFI.
We want to simulate the deep or shallow sea's color through the digital light spectrum.
But me and my friend are all the layman of the electric engineering, I am a programmer, and he is architectural designer.
So I want to record all my study experiences and problems here.
Wish me Luck!
